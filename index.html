  <p>Hey I want to say sorry about everything that I did which made you insecure, disappointed, unvalued or anything. I really didn’t mean to do or say any of this. After all till now I never talk to a female so much and actually tbh till now the only place I was comfortable was with my male friend and with them when I or we talk ... its was different like we make fun of each other but also protect each other and it was very different but what i mean is that with you, I feel comfortable, but the difference is that when I am with you I only want to hear ... I mean I prefer listening to you than talking ...yes i love talking to you but I love it more when you’re the one talking ....its something about your voice, I never in my life find a sound such as yours which feels very warm, comforting, motivational, genuine, and another thing which even I don’t know how to express it ..its like I am attracted to your voice ....and if I start talking about you I might never stop ....so what I want to say is that you mean a lot to me and you really do ....and you know 'I am very bad with words so I hope you can read eyes' ....and yk i am sorry I am really sorry ..yk for what I said ....and i hope you can forgive me and my doing of the 2025 ......i don’t know how to say it but you’re really precious to me you might think I am just another guy thats saying but you know you don’t have to believe me I will prove it ...after all I did take maths nahhhh .... you ....</p>
  <p>THIS WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR WHERE I WON’T THINK ABOUT STARTING OVER , BUT ABOUT CONTINUING BECAUSE I’M FINALLY ON THE RIGHT PATH</p>
  <p>At last, may your future be 56x kinder and better than your past .....more laughter, fewer tears, endless reasons to smile. You truly deserve it.</p>
  <p>GIVE YOUR BEST ....I will always be with you no matter what ...yes we might get angry at each other but I will always come back to ask for your forgiveness and I hope you forgive me ..... but I will never let you be alone ..I will always be with you and that’s promise i was, I will and I always will just believe me in this ........ I love you &lt;3</p>
